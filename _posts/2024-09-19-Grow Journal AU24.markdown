### Germination

On the 18th of August, 4 out of 6 seedlings have popped out of their shells, and by the 19th all plants have presumably begun photosynthesis. The two labels obscured in the below image are Lemon Pie and Forbidden Runtz, both bred by Fast Buds. Gorilla Cookies is another autoflower bred by Fast Buds. Bourbon Berry, the odd one out, is an autoflower bred by Twenty20.

### Veg Day 11

Having long outgrown their starter cubes, all the plants have transitioned well into into their reservoirs. While there is no obvious signs of a leader(s) yet, there is a probable calcium deficiency noticeable on one of the Gorilla Cookies (back row, farthest right).

### Veg Day 15

With the plants now fully acclimated to the RDWC system, and the probable calcium deficiency taken care of, the plants are beginning to really fill out. The three Gorilla Cookies (whole back row) are pulling ahead, with Bourbon Berry (front row, farthest left) not far behind. 

The Forbidden Runtz (front row, farthest right) is the smallest of the pack so far, but is otherwise healthy and shows no signs of nutrient deficiency or burn.

### Flower Day 5

Just under one week into flower, the plants are transitioning nicely and beginning to put on lots of bud sites.

### Flower Day 9

Despite some minor issues with nutrient concentration due to faulty measuring equipment, the crop is looking fantastic. While the Forbidden Runtz is still the smallest of the pack, you can see it has very tight internodal spacing, and has a pretty high density of bud sites. It's larger sisters are similarly healthy.
