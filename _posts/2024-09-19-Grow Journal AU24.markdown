Batch AU24 is a 6-plant group of autoflowering cannabis being grown in a 50 gallon recirculating deep water culture system. The group germinated between August 18th & 19th, and is expected to be harvest around November 11th. This is our first run using a RDWC system, so while we are using relativley fresh genetics, we are mostly sticking to a known and trusted breeder for our seeds. Our nutrition/supplement needs are covered with a custom regimen combining products from General Hydroponics and Botanicare. Light is provided by 2x ROI-E720 LED fixtures, with an exceptional PAR output of 1850 umol ppf, these fixtures are more than sufficient for our grow space.

### Germination

On the 18th of August, 4 out of 6 seedlings have popped out of their shells, and by the 19th all plants have presumably begun photosynthesis. The two labels obscured in the below image are Lemon Pie and Forbidden Runtz, both bred by Fast Buds. Gorilla Cookies is another autoflower bred by Fast Buds. Bourbon Berry, the odd one out, is an autoflower bred by Twenty20.

### Veg Begins

Between August 21st – 23rd all plants have properly began vegetative growth, and are now transferred into the RDWC system. A layout diagram has been made for easy reference throughout this article.

### Veg Day 11

Having long outgrown their starter cubes, all the plants have transitioned well into into their reservoirs. While there is no obvious signs of a leader(s) yet, there is a probable calcium deficiency noticeable on one of the Gorilla Cookies (back row, farthest right).

### Veg Day 15

With the plants now fully acclimated to the RDWC system, and the probable calcium deficiency taken care of, the plants are beginning to really fill out. The three Gorilla Cookies (whole back row) are pulling ahead, with Bourbon Berry (front row, farthest left) not far behind. 

The Forbidden Runtz (front row, farthest right) is the smallest of the pack so far, but is otherwise healthy and shows no signs of nutrient deficiency or burn.

### Flower Day 5

Just under one week into flower, the plants are transitioning nicely and beginning to put on lots of bud sites.

### Flower Day 9

Despite some minor issues with nutrient concentration due to faulty measuring equipment, the crop is looking fantastic. While the Forbidden Runtz is still the smallest of the pack, you can see it has very tight internodal spacing, and has a pretty high density of bud sites. It's larger sisters are similarly healthy.

### Flower Day 12

On day F9 (after taking the above photo) the entire crop was lollipopped. Lollipopping is a very popular technique used by many growers alike, but the question of why you do it is an important one. Lollipopping's definition as I see it, is removing unnecessary leaf and branches that will just flat out not make to the surface of the canopy. This will not only make the plant focus more on its productive branches, but will also help the plant breathe.

Removing this extra material will allow a better exchange of airflow, allowing the removal of stagnant O2 left over from photosynthesis, and providing a better supply of fresh CO2 (*i.e. "Breathing"*). In a more traditional soil or semi-soil system, this may also help with pests, but will have little effect in that regard with our medium.

As you can see, we go for a much less aggressive approach than some growers. Our goal is to only remove branches that would essentially feel like a waste of time to even bother processing once harvested. Good quality LED lights tend to provide great light penetration, so in our case, it is really only the bottom couple of nodes on each plant that get removed.

Overall with the group firmly in their transitional period, upward growth has slowed somewhat. However, all of the plants continue stacking new nodes, and have begun the formation of future colas. Even our outlier, Forbidden Runtz, is looking very promising at this stage.
