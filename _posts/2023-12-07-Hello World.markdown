J. Delvin Botanicals is a Section 3780.29 cultivator of high quality cannabis located in Knox County, Ohio.

In upcoming posts, we’ll cover topics such as deep water culture systems, cannabis nutrition, and effective curing practices. Our goal is to share practical insights and techniques to enhance your cultivation process.

This project is spearheaded by JD Henson, a seasoned grower with a wealth of industry experience from his time living in legal states. The IT side of things—like this website—are managed by Ethan Cochran.

We look forward to contributing to and learning from the online cannabis growing community.
