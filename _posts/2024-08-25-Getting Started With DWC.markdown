We recently started working with a recirculating deep water culture system, or RDWC. Since we'd been running different variations of soilless systems for a while now, this wasn't too big of a jump. However we have had to make some changes to accomodate the new medium. In this post we'll give you a basic rundown of our nutrition line. We reccomend running these nutrients at thier manufaturer-reccomended specs, and adjusting as needed to suit your needs.

## Nutrition
Nutritional needs will be provided for by [GH FloraNova Grow and Bloom](https://amzn.to/3AAXlrr). The FloraNova line by General Hydroponics is a comprehensive "1-part" nutrient system. This means you could technically run only a single nutrient depending on whether your in veg or bloom, and your plants would survive. However, we want our plants to properly thrive, so we'll be adding some additional supplements and incoulents.

## Supplements
### ArmorSi and CALiMAGic
[Armor Si](https://amzn.to/3Xj1d9G) is a silicon source derived from Potassium Silicate, and as a result provides some potassium as well. It improves plant structure and foliar development, increases yield and improves bud production. [CALiMAGic](https://amzn.to/3yUARkY) is a Calcium and Magnesium source and helps prevent bud end rot and tip burn. These supplements together help to provide defense and vigor to your plants.

### Liquid KoolBloom
It only takes a small amount of [Liquid KoolBloom](https://amzn.to/3yRbArQ) to deliver a healthy infusion of phosphorus and potassium to your plants. Use it throughout flower to enhance the production of aromas in your buds. During the last two weeks of the cycle, increase use to promote bulking and to facilitate ripening.

### Floralicious Plus
[Floralicious Plus](https://amzn.to/4dBUNIf) is a humic acid source derived from Protein Hydrolysate, Potassium Sulfate, and Sea Kelp. Humic acids enhance metabolic growth, which will improve the performance of your cannabis plants at all stages of growth, contributing to both the quantity and quality of your bud.

## Inoculants
### HydroGuard
[Hydroguard](https://amzn.to/3T4tdv5) is a bacterial root inoculant. There are two main approaches to protecting the health of your reservior. One is to effectively sterilize your reservior with something like [FloraKleen](https://amzn.to/3Xhgh7s). While that is certainly a valid option, it makes using things like our next reccomendation below, pretty much impossible. Instead, we choose to use beneficial Bacillus bacteria to outcompete any potential nasties in our reservior. It's like probiotics for your weed!

### RhizoBlast
Our last critical component is another of Botanicare's, what can we say, they make some killer inoculants. We won't lie, [RhizoBlast](https://amzn.to/4dDUFrI) is not cheap stuff. This proprietary formula contains a blend of nutrients that help with root growth and nutrient uptake. There's good reason we go out of our way to use HydroGuard in place of FloraKleen, even though Rhizo Blast is as pricey as it is. The stuff works. I'd say it's magic, but that's probably proprietary too.
