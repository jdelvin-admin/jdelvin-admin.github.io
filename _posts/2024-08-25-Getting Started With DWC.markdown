We recently started working with a recirculating deep water culture system, or RDWC. Since we've been running different variations of soilless systems for a while now, this wasn't too big of a jump. However we've needed to make some changes to accomodate the new medium nonetheless. In this post we'll give you a basic rundown of our nutrition line. We reccomend running these nutrients at thier manufacturer-reccomended specs, and adjusting/supplementing as you see fit for your strains/phenos.

## Nutrition
Our base nutritional needs will be provided for by [GH FloraNova Grow and Bloom](https://amzn.to/3AAXlrr). The FloraNova line by General Hydroponics is a comprehensive "1-part" nutrient system. This means you can technically run just a single nutrient at any given time, depending on whether your plants are in veg or bloom, and your plants would survive and grow just fine. However we want our plants to properly thrive, so we'll be adding some additional supplements and incoulents to really give them an extra edge.

## Supplements

Supplements will fill out the niche of additional micro-nutrients, minerals, and misc elements that plants crave for general health, vigor, and fun biochemical stuff like terpene production in late flower.

### ArmorSi and CALiMAGic
[Armor Si](https://amzn.to/3Xj1d9G) is a silicon source derived from Potassium Silicate, and as a result provides some potassium as well. It improves plant structure and foliar development, increases yield and improves bud production. [CALiMAGic](https://amzn.to/3yUARkY) is a Calcium and Magnesium source and helps prevent bud end rot and tip burn. These supplements together help to provide defense and vigor to your plants.

### Liquid KoolBloom
It only takes a small amount of [Liquid KoolBloom](https://amzn.to/3yRbArQ) to deliver a healthy infusion of phosphorus and potassium to your plants. Use it throughout flower to enhance the production of aromas in your buds. During the last two weeks of the cycle, increase use to promote bulking and to facilitate ripening.

### Floralicious Plus
[Floralicious Plus](https://amzn.to/4dBUNIf) is a humic acid source derived from Protein Hydrolysate, Potassium Sulfate, and Sea Kelp. Humic acids enhance metabolic growth, which will improve the performance of your cannabis plants at all stages of growth, contributing to both the quantity and quality of your bud.

## Inoculants

Inoculants provide biological life to your growing medium. Bacterias, algeas, virsues and more microlife are already everywhere all the time, might as well try to control what you're harboring...

### HydroGuard
[Hydroguard](https://amzn.to/3T4tdv5) is a bacterial root inoculant. There are two main approaches to protecting the health of your reservior. One is to effectively sterilize your reservior with something like [FloraKleen](https://amzn.to/3Xhgh7s). While that is certainly a valid option, it makes using things like our next reccomendation below, pretty much impossible. Instead, we choose to use beneficial Bacillus bacteria to outcompete any potential nasties in our reservior. It's like probiotics for your weed!

### RhizoBlast
Our last critical component is another of Botanicare's, what can we say, they make some killer inoculants. We won't lie, [RhizoBlast](https://amzn.to/4dDUFrI) is not cheap stuff. This proprietary formula contains a blend of nutrients that help with root growth and nutrient uptake. There's good reason we go out of our way to use HydroGuard in place of FloraKleen, even though Rhizo Blast is as pricey as it is. The stuff works. I'd say it's magic, but that's probably proprietary too.

## Tools

We wanted to throw this in at the end as a little bonus. Properly measuring and monitoring your nutrient solution is absolutley key in a DWC system. Here are some of the tools we've found the most helpful.

### pH Pen
A solid pH pen is important to keep your plants within a healthy range. pH is important not only for nutrient uptake, but also to help keep unwanted organisms out of your reservior. We love the Hach Pro pH+, but as long as you keep your pen calibrated and replace the probe as needed, you should be able to use any reputable pH pen.

### EC Pen
EC is an important metric to know the overal concetration of disovled solids in your nutrient solution. THis allows you to confirm a proper mix, and to make differential adjustments to your nutrients. A reliable EC pen or two is always great to have on hand to make sure you're on the right track.

### Various Sized Pipettes
You can fiddle aroud with teaspons and conversion charts all way, getting nutrients all over your hands and counters. Or you can embrace metric supremacy and buy some standard pipettes. We like to keep [1mL](https://amzn.to/4cF4u7p) and [5mL](https://amzn.to/3WUFq6G) on hand for small volumes. For larger volumes we use a [blunt syringe](https://amzn.to/3T4JEr8) or a [glass beaker](https://amzn.to/4cB84jb). If you want high precision with ease consider in investing in a [micropipette](https://amzn.to/3MlybzR). We like using the 1mL pipettes and find thier accuracy to be sufficient for our needs, but the micropipette is a fantastic option if you have accessibility needs.
