## Relevant Sections

### Section 3780.04 - Allowable forms of adult use cannabis.

> This section outlines allowable forms of cannabis. Nearly anything you could possibly want to produce is covered and allowed. However section 29 disallows home growers from using hydrocarbon base extraction, so concentrate options are limited.

### Section 3780.29 - Home grow

> This section is the primary focus of this guide, so we'll be deep diving each detail below.

#### Plant Limit

Each adult aged 21+ in a household may grow 6 plants at a time, up to a maximum of 12 plants per household total.

#### Location

Plants must be in a secured closet, room, greenhouse, or other private area on the grounds of the residence that prevents access by individuals less than twenty-one years of age.

#### Live Plants

You may transfer up to 6 cannabis plants to another legal adult cannabis user as long as there is a gift (no sale) and is not advertised.

#### Possesion

An adult cannabis users may store cannabis in thier own home, whether they purchased it at a dispensary, or it was home grown.

### Section 3780.33 - Liabilities and immunities

> This one is a lot of legalese, but at it's core it's meant to protect adult users of cannabis from thier use being held against them in regards to parental rights, protect users from being disqualified for medical care, and essentially is a major "legalize"-ing componenet of the code for end-users.
> It does not, and is not meant to, protect adult users from legal conseqences for unlawful use, such as driving under the influence.
