### [Section 3780.04](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3780.04) - Allowable forms of adult use cannabis.

> This section outlines allowable forms of cannabis. Nearly anything you could possibly want to posses is covered and allowed.

### [Section 3780.29](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3780.29) - Home grow

> As Section 29 growers, this is the primary focus of our article, so we'll be deep diving each detail below.

#### Plant Limit

Each adult aged 21+ in a household may grow 6 plants at a time, up to a maximum of 12 plants per household total.

#### Location

Plants must be in a secured closet, room, greenhouse, or other private area on the grounds of the residence that prevents access by individuals less than twenty-one years of age. 

> It may be possible with locked gates and a tall enough privacy fence to be compliant with this section and still grow outdoors; but at minimum a locked greenhouse behind a privacy fence is recommended.

#### Processing

You are allowed to process your harvested product by manual or mechanical means. 

> This provision is rather vague and short, but I believe this is specifically outlining that it's legal to cut down, trim, cure, and further process your cannabis how you wish, with one exception ([see below](#section-378099---what-you-cannot-do)). 

#### Live Plants

You may transfer up to 6 cannabis plants to another legal adult cannabis user as long as it is a gift (no sale) and is not advertised.

#### Possesion

An adult cannabis users may store cannabis in thier own home, whether they purchased it at a dispensary, or it was home grown. 

> No limits or numbers are mentioned, so it can be reasoned as long as one is following all other sections of the code and other applicable laws, **any amount can be stored** at an individuals residence.

### [Section 3780.33](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3780.33) - Liabilities and immunities

> This one is a lot of legalese, but at it's core it's meant to protect adult users of cannabis from thier use being held against them in regards to parental rights, protect users from being disqualified for medical care, and essentially is a major "legalize"-ing componenet of the code for end-users.
> It does not, and is not meant to, protect adult users from legal conseqences for unlawful use, such as driving under the influence.

### [Section 3780.99](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3780.99) - **What You CANNOT Do**

- Grow, cultivate, or process cannabis anywhere except your primary residence.
- Allow individuals under 21 to use, cultivate, process, transfer, or transport cannabis.
- Process cannabis by hydrocarbon-based extraction (Butane Hash Oil, etc.)
- Sell or profit from cannabis

Any individual who violates these rules is guilty of the illegal trafficking in drugs under section 2925.03 of the Revised Code and the illegal manufacture of drugs under section 2925.04 of the Revised Code.
