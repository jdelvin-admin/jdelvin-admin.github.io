This is a very early version of our [Aurora Soul](https://www.aurorainnovations.com/soul-liquid-nutrients)-based nutrition line. This was applied to cannabis plants in a coco coir and perlite mix with a combination of hand-delivery and automated irrigation systems. Feel free to customize and adapt it for your needs.
