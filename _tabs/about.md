## About This Site

This website serves as a repository of information related to the growing, curing/storage, processing, and applications of cannabis. The information you'll find here is a synthesis of our own experience from years of growing, general best practices from authoritative sources, and crowd-sourced information from niche online communities. 

While the site is primarily documentation for our own reference, we hope others will find the information here useful as well.
