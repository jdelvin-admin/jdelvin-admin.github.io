## Who We Are

J. Delvin Botanicals is a [Section 3780.29](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3780.29)-compliant cultivator of high quality cannabis, located in Knox Cty. Ohio. 

The project is spearheaded by JD Henson, a seasoned grower with a wealth of industry experience from his time living and working in legal states like Colorado & California. 

The IT side of things, like this website, is managed by [Ethan Cochran](https://ethancochran.com). 

## About This Site

This website serves as a repository of information related to the growing, curing/storage, processing, and applications of cannabis. The information you'll find here is a synthesis of our own experience from years of growing, general best practices from authoritative sources, and crowd-sourced information from niche online communities. 

While the site is primarily documentation for our own reference, we hope others will find the information here useful as well.
