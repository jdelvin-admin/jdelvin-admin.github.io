| Hach Pro pH+   | [Order](https://amzn.to/3MhBmbT) | The Pro pH+ is not only easy to calibrate, easy to use, and highly accurate, but best of all, it has a replacable probe head so you don't have to buy a new one every year.   |
| Bluelab pH Pen | [Order](https://amzn.to/3T5w5rB) | Bluelab is like the Logitech of pH pens. They're a house name, and almost always reliable. It makes for a solid budget option, or a good backup to double check measurements. |
| Micropipette   | [Order](https://amzn.to/3X0zZTN) | This ONiLAB pipettor will make handling accurate volumes of nutrients *(particularly important during seedling stages with small feed volumes)* an absolute breeze.           |
